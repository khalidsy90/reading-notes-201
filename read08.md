1. **```<div>``` elements are often used as containing elementsto group together sections of a page.**
2. **Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.**
3. **The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)**
4. **Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.**
5. **Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).**
6. **Grids help create professional and flexible designs.**
7. **CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.**
8. **You can include multiple CSS files in one page.**
